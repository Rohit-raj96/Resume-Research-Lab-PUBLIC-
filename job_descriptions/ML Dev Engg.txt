Job description
This internship focuses on applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems using data-driven approaches. Interns will gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The program covers supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, and model deployment using Python.
Youll work directly with senior developers, participate in code reviews, and build portfolio-worthy projects that solve actual business problems.
What Youll Do
Develop and train machine learning models using Python.
Build predictive systems for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.
Debug and optimize models to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Learn to identify data quality issues and apply preprocessing techniques.
Integrate ML models into real-world applications via REST APIs.
Deploy trained models on cloud platforms for scalability and performance.
Team Collaboration (Daily Scrum Meeting).
Use Git/GitHub for version control. Work in a simulated Agile team environment.
Machine Learning Fundamentals
Understand supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning with real-world use cases.
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
